* Interpolation Bases 
 + The taylor basis becomes increasingly ill conditioned with the order, due to the limiting behaviour of the functional x^n in n
 + The fourier basis is better
   + Cannot just use sin with no phase shift as a large chunk is missing near 0 due to sin being purely an odd function
     + use cosine as well
   + poor at approximating sharp corners (limits to a spike at the corner decreasing in width but not height)
 + Solution is the chebyshev family of polynomials Tn(x) = cos(n arccos(x))
   + 
 + Legendre Polynomials
   + 
 + Hermite Polynomials
   + appears often in QM
 + Laguerre Polynomials
   + appears if you want to do fourier trasforms with bessel functions
* Numerical Integration 
 + Integration can usually be derived in an explicit form from the polynomial interpolation coefficients
 + Differentiation is similar, but tends to be ill-posed
   + 
* Assignment
 + Approximate 1/(1+x^2) using multiple bases
 + Higher order does not necessarily give higher accuracy
